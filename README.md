# Neural subdomain solver for magnetostatic field computations

This repository contains the code which implements a neural subdomain solver for magnetostatic field computations.
As a geometry mapping, we use AD-differentiable Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), which are implemented in the repository "./src/."
